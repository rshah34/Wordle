# Wordle
Welcome to Wordle Unlimited! 

The rules are pretty simple: If you are familiar with a standard Wordle game from NYT, 
then this game is very similar. You have 6 guesses to reveal the random word. After each individual guess, there will 
be three potential things that can happen: First, if a letter is colored gray, then that means the letter is not in 
the word. Second, if a letter is colored yellow, that means the letter is in the word but not in the correct spot. 
Finally, if a letter is colored green, that means it is the correct letter in the correct spot of that word. 

Note that your guess will not go through in the game if the word is not registered in the official Wordle dictionary. 

After the game ends, a message will appear telling you whether or not you guessed the word. It will also appear on the screen to 
indicate that the game has ended. 

At the bottom, you can see that you can start a <b>New Game</b> at any time, or you can "Save" your progress on one game. 
Clicking <b>Load Game</b> will give you the game that you previously saved.

Watch out for some words that may have multiple of one letter! The game will only tell you if at least one of that letter is present.
